# Auto Feeder Arduino Sketch

The Assistive Feeder is a robot arm with a spoon that lets those who would
need human assistance to eat a meal feed themselves more independently.

The robot scoops food out of plates or bowls, and its scooping path can be reprogrammed
to work with almost any circular plate or bowl. It can store 4 different bowl/plate profiles.
